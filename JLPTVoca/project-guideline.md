# üéØ JLPT Flashcard App: Mission & Core Product

### üìå App Overview (App Context)

*   **Project Name (Tentative):** JLPT Scheduler
*   **Platform & Language:** iOS (Swift)
*   **Core Problem to Solve:** To efficiently convert about 3,000 JLPT N2 vocabulary words into long-term memory within 6 months without forgetting them.
*   **Differentiation Strategy:** Focus on an intuitive level system with workload management to keep users motivated, rather than a complex algorithm.

### üë§ Persona

*   **User:** A student preparing for the JLPT for employment purposes.
*   **Learning Goal:** To obtain the **JLPT N2** certification through consistent study over 6+ months.
*   **Main Task:** Memorize a set amount of vocabulary (approx. 3,000 words) daily and retain it in long-term memory.
*   **Biggest Pain Point:** "I forget words as soon as I memorize them." With limited time, a method is needed to systematically manage and review a vast amount of vocabulary.
